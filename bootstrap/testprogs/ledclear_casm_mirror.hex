# This file is edited to closely mimic the ledclear.casm file in pure hex
# The ledclear.hex version is much more easy to understand.

# ledclear.casm is a test of the labelling additions of cherryasm,
# and all ldr r1, [r0] instructions in the file are replaced by a jump-to-label
# This is replicated here.
